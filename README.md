# Example Motiv Project
This is an example project to allow candidates to demonstrate technical ability.

The intent behind this test is for you to be able to use a set of loose requirements to adhere to while also giving you flexibility to add your own vision and initiative.

You can either Fork this repo or download and send to the team in a .zip for us to review

# Base Guidelines:
You are presented with a greenfield project and tasked with the following:
1) Create a new Razor page that contains a form to take in personal and financial details
2) On form submit, redirect to a result page that displays an example finance product that can change based on financial input from step 1
3) Create a new Razor page that displays user details fetched from an API (E.g. you can use https://randomuser.me/api/ to get a random user JSON)

# Suggestions
3) For steps (1), (2) and (3) consider how you would use CSS to improve the UI, you can use additional styling features as needed
4) If not already considered, how could the data from (1) be saved securely (This can be mocked)
5) Where possible, consider making use of the app.settings file (E.g. for the URL in step 3). Additionally, consider how you may want to put in a setting only applicable to a production environment

# Finally
If you are unable to implement a certain component or would rather pseudocode with explanations, please provide/bundle an additional text file with comments which will be read to understand and discussed during the interview process.
